1. I want to add a file system for the saves and to transfer data between levels. For now, they are basically isolated


Changes to be done:
1. Allow two versions of graphics, one to use images (as is right now), and the other version to use the pixels like in earliest version of Heyo Engine
2. Fix up sounds	: It's pretty good, woo 12/27/17
3. Add more tools to a sprite	
4. Add more support to different type of images, not only png in the textures class
